# HW2-Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio that I will add applications that I build in the future to this portfolio. I also plan on improving this portfolio, clean up the code, and make it more responsive. Also in the future I want to improve the design and make it cleaner and more appealing.

## Usage

Click on the links found in the top right to take you directly to the desired section. Click on the first image to be taken to a random project we have done in class.
