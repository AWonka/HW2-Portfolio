                <p class="about-me">I have been into computers ever since I was a young lad. I have built multiple custom PCs for myself and friends. I recently started my programming journey with Georgia Tech's Coding Boot Camp. So far this journey has been amazing and has paid off in my current job. Outside of all that I enjoy hanging with my family and friends as well as playing video games. My favorite video game series are The Legend of Zelda, Warcraft(even though I haven't played that much recently), Diablo, Halo, and Doom. Also I love metal, enough said.</p>
